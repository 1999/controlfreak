Control Freak was created by Michael Mahemoff (http://mahemoff.com), a
Developer Advocate at Google.

System Icon from Tango Icon Library
http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library
which is licensed under a Public Domain license (Can I get a Woo Yeah?!!)

Uses the Codemirror editor (http://codemirror.net/), which is licensed under a
zlib-style model. A custom package was compressed with Closure, using the 
tool on CodeMirror's website.

Thanks to Adam Thurlow (http://thurloat.com/) for incorporating CodeMirror and 
prettying up the UI.

Now supported and developed by Dmitry Sorin (http://staypositive.ru).
